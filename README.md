## LibGDX Setup tutorial
**Step 1:** Download [libGdx set up tool](https://libgdx.com/dev/project_generation/)  
**Step 2:** Install [IntelliJ Community edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows)   
**Step 3:** Run the installed package and set everything to default  
**Step 4:** Open the folder that you are going to use as your project folder and clone the main repository into you device  
**Step 5:** Open the project with IntelliJ  
**Step 6:** Go to Setting -> Plugins -> Browse repository  
**Step 7:** Search for Kotlin and libGdx and download both of them (Kotlin should already be installed already, this is just to make sure)

- This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CN13SZpApR0&list=PLS9MbmO_ssyCZ9Tjfay2tOQoaOVoG59Iy&index=2) is for setting up IntelliJ with libGdx but is very old so beware.
  
## Regarding the file directory of the reposition
**! DO NOT PANIC! I REPEAT, DO NOT PANIC AND READ CAREFULLY!**  

**.idea** folder is not important at all so ignore it   

**test** folder is the most important folder which will contain everything  

**asset** folder is in **test\core\asset**  and the asset will be further divided into other folders including **..\sprite** (have all the cut and raw files) and **..\sprite_sheet** (have the sprite sheets files after being processed from raw)  

**test\core\src\com.mygdx.game\...** should be the folder of all classes from the game

**For more information on folders and directories, you can watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrXgtiUOlM&list=PLS9MbmO_ssyCZ9Tjfay2tOQoaOVoG59Iy&index=4)**
